Aircraft grid
-------------

Each aircraft card has controls of the form ``1 x 1`` and a **Dist** field:

* **1 × 1** — how many aircraft to spawn along each side of the grid.
* **Dist** — side length of the grid in meters.

Aircraft types
--------------

* **F450Aircraft** — four rotor drone.
* **DeltaQuadAircraft** — VTOL with four vertical lift rotors and one rear-facing propeller.
* **Cessna172Aircraft** — fixed-wing airplane.

Payloads
--------

* **BasePayload** spawns a cargo box with configurable **Mass (kg)**.  
  Aircraft equipped with a gripper can lift this box and use it as a payload in scenarios.
